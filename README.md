# Movie Theater Demo Website

This is a movie theater demo website I built for my portfolio to showcase my React.JS skills.

## Built With:

<a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/"><b>TMDB API</b></a> To fetch movie info (titles, descriptions, release dates, ratings, images...).
<a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/rest/auth"><b>Firebase Auth Rest API</b></a> To authenticate anonymous login.
<a href="https://create-react-app.dev/"><b>Create React App</b></a> Used to bootstrap the project.

## Features

<ul>
    <li>Login authentication</li>
    <li>Ticket booking</li>
    <li>Slideshow</li>
    <li>Slider</li>
</ul>

## `Login`

<p>Anyone can login to this website by typing anything in username and password fields.</p>
<p>Login is not required to use this website. Login allows access to profile page and ticket booking feature.</p>
<p>Username and booked tickets data stays stored in localStorage until user logout.</p>
